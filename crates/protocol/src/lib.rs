//! Wire types for the Playwright protocol.
//!
//! This crate contains the serde-serializable types used for communication
//! with the Playwright server over JSON-RPC. These types represent the
//! "protocol layer" - the shapes of data as they appear on the wire.
//!
//! # Design Philosophy
//!
//! Types in this crate are:
//! * Pure data: No behavior beyond serialization/deserialization
//! * 1:1 with protocol: Match Playwright's protocol.yml schema
//! * Stable: Changes only when the wire protocol changes
//!
//! Higher-level ergonomic APIs are built on top of these types in `pw-rs`.
